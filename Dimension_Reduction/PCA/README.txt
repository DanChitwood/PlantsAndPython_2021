This directory contains the R and python scripts used to generate the PCA plots for the expression data of arabidopsis. As well as python script used for a subset of 100 genes that was done as initial test.

The R script describes the steps used to prepare the dataset into the files that are then used in the python script for the PCA. The R script is based on the script made by Sofia Zorrilla.

The python script shows the packages and commands used to do the PCA and generate the plots (also in this directory). 

The input data used was the file MapRateFiltered_v1.csv created by group 2, stored in the following path:

/mnt/research/HRT841_F21/Class_project/Arabidopsis_expression_matrix/DataClean/

Paths for all files are the original ones used in my hpcc directory.   

Explained variance ratio obtained with the data and these scripts was:

Explained variance ratio:
PC1     0.26064241 
PC2     0.13431257
